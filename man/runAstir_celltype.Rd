Run Astir cell type prediction

Predict cell types using 'Astir'. This package requires the python library `astir` and `reticulate`. This function is still experimental and was not extensively tested in cyCONDOR. In one of the next release we will document it's usage in more details on a dedicated vignette.
For the moment if you want to know more feel free to reach out on our `Slack` channel. For more details on the different parameters refer to `Astir` documentation.
